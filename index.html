            top fighters.He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind
            by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which
            would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only
            to Shanks, his brothers and crew. He believes that being the Pirate
            King means having the most freedom in the world. Born in Foosha
            Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the
            Revolutionary Army, and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D.

          <p>
            Luffy's rubberiness is a result of eating a devil fruit called the
            Gum-Gum Fruit. It makes him immune to electric attacks and most
            blunt forces, also giving him the ability to stretch his body at
            will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body
            to deliver punches, kicks, head butts, and body checks or for
            propulsion. Like others exposed to Devil Fruit, Luffy cannot swim;
            when he is submerged in water or contacts the Sea-Prism Stone, he
            loses his strength and cannot move on his own. In addition to his
            Devil Fruit powers, he has immense strength, durability, speed,
            reflexes, agility, endurance, and stamina. Luffy's signature attack
            is the Gum-Gum Pistol (ゴムゴムの銃ピストル, Gomu Gomu no Pisutoru),
            a punch which he learned during years of training.
